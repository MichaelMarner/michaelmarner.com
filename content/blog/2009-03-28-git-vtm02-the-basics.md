This video hits up the terminal and starts using git. We start by creating a git repository, which is super easy with Git. Then, we look at adding files to the repository, and commiting changes.

  <strong>Notes</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  In this video, I specifically create a project using:
</p>

<pre>git init</pre>

. If you are working on your own projects, this is how you will work. However, a lot of the time you will be starting work on an already existing project. In this case, you don&#8217;t create a new repo using git init, instead you _clone_ an already existing repository. The basic is this:

<pre>git clone path/to/repository</pre>

I will cover this in a later video, but I think it is important enough to mention here.

Another thing that I could have covered in more detail is the staging area. There is actually a lot more that you can do with it than I mentioned in this video. However, that will come later. For the first 3 videos (at least) I want to just get the basics down.
