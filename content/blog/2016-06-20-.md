In the [previous post][1] we explored how to do drag-n-drop sorting of Ember records using JQuery UI&#8217;s Sortable plugin.

What we have above works perfectly for re-ordering a list of existing elements. But what happens if we add a record? We will need to initialise the new record with an index.Â You need to make a decision here about where you want your new record to go. In this example, we&#8217;ll add to the end of the list.

### Add Note Form

We will add a form after our table for adding a new note. Our template will now look like this:

### A Controller

We will need a controller to handle adding the new note to the data store.

<pre class="toolbar:2 lang:default decode:true ">ember generate controller list</pre>

And in here we will have an action that adds the note. The key thing is to set the index for the new record to be equal to the number of records. This will ensure it is placed at the end.

Now when a user fills out the form and presses the Add button, a new record is added to the store, just like we expect. Ember triggers a re-render of the table and our new record appears.

Have a look in the Ember Inspector and you&#8217;ll see the index is set correctly.
