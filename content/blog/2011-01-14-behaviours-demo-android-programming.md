Hey Everyone

So this week I became a member sponsor on www.3dbuzz.com. The first thing I had a look at was their XNA Behaviour Programming videos, which are the first in their set on AI programming. However, not being particularly interested in XNA, I implemented the algorithms presented in the videos for Android.

Here&#8217;s a video of the demo running on my Nexus One:

Since I was on Android and only using the Android and OpenGL ES libraries, I had to write a lot of low level code to replace the XNA functionality that 3DBuzz&#8217;s videos rely on. I also had to implement an on-screen joystick. I might write up a couple of posts on the more interesting parts of the code (what is not in the videos) soon.

Thanks  
Michael
